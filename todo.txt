X- None of the possible messages include pronouns, so I'll remove the pronoun selector
X- I'm going to integrate local storage so if the browser reloads for some reason, it'll preserve state
X- The inactive player blanket covers the name input which isn't necessary, I think I'll have it just cover the buttons
X- I'd like Question # {x} to be aware of when the game is over and display Game Over instead of Question #17
X- Fix active/hover button states
X- Fix player flipping bug on refresh

- Make reset undoable
- I'm going to try to make it offline compatible so that it could theoretically load up entirely from iPad cache with no internet (never done this before, no promises, but I think I can)
